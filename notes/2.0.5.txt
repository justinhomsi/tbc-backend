Summary
Increased the maximum number of realms that can be listed in the Realm List.
Updated the Terms of Use.
Created an option to disable UI Acceleration for users of select video cards experiencing graphical corruption of the User Interface. To utilize this option, enter the following line to the Config.wtf file, located in the WTF subfolder of the game:
Set UIFaster "x"
Where x equals:
   0 - This turns off all UI acceleration
   1 - For Internal Use Only - DO NOT USE!
   2 - Enables partial UI acceleration only.
   3 - Enables all UI acceleration. 
Example:
   Set UIFaster "2"
Note: For users experiencing graphical corruption of the User Interface, it is recommended to try option 2 in order to correct the problem. If this does not solve the issue, then use option 0 to disable all UI acceleration.[1]
